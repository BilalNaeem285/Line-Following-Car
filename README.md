This project implements an intelligent line-following robotic car using the STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill) microcontroller. The robot uses IR sensors to detect and follow a predefined path, while an ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors the surroundings to detect obstacles. Motor drivers control four DC motors, allowing precise movement and speed control. When an obstacle is detected within a certain distance, the system responds by stopping or adjusting its movement to avoid collisions. This project demonstrates real-time sensor integration, motor control, and embedded system programming using the STM32 platform.
